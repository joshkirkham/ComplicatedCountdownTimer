# ComplicatedCountdownTimer
A countdown timer that is way more heavy weight then it should be.

## Details
Written in LabVIEW with the LINX maker extensions allowing communication with an Arduino.
The program contains a countdown timer which uses an external clock source (I used a 555 timer in the astable configuration) and triggers an alarm (I used a buzzer and some LEDs).
